    "The bank runs direct marketing campaigns via phone calls to potential and existing clients. Not all clients are interested, and calling uninterested clients is costly and time-consuming.\n",

    "Objective:\n",
    "Build a classification model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no) based on client characteristics and previous campaign outcomes."
